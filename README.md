# **Too Much Milk Problem**

## **Project Overview**
This project tackles the classic synchronization problem, *Too Much Milk*, using the C programming language. The goal is to implement a solution that prevents two or more roommates from buying milk simultaneously, ensuring efficiency and consistency in a shared environment.

## **Key Features**
- Implements synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.
- Utilizes fundamental concurrency concepts such as **mutexes**, **semaphores**, or **condition variables**.
- Ensures minimal resource wastage and avoids redundant purchases.

## **Technologies**
- **Language**: C
- **Libraries**: POSIX Threads (pthreads) or platform-specific concurrency tools.
